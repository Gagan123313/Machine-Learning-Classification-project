## 📌 Overview

This project performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and builds a classification model to predict the probability of customer default. The goal is to help banks manage credit risk more effectively.

## 🎯 Objective
 
* This project aims to analyze bank customer data to identify patterns and factors that indicate whether a client may face difficulties in repaying their installments. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling, the project helps uncover key driver variables that strongly influence loan default risk.

* The insights and prediction models can be used to make informed lending decisions, such as rejecting high-risk applicants, adjusting loan amounts, or setting higher interest rates for risky customers. This ensures that creditworthy customers are not wrongly denied loans and the bank can better manage its risk portfolio.
